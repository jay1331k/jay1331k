## 🧠 About Me

> *"I see problems as puzzles waiting to be solved from the ground up."*

I'm an **AI Engineer** and **Creative Technologist** who believes in understanding systems from their very foundation. My passion lies in pushing the boundaries of what's possible with AI, turning complex theoretical concepts into practical solutions that make a real difference.

🎯 **Current Focus**: AI Agent Systems, LLM Orchestration, and Behavioral AI Applications  
🚀 **Mission**: Building AI systems that truly understand and assist human cognition  
🔬 **Approach**: First-principles thinking meets creative experimentation  
🌟 **Recognition**: Google Hackathon Top Submission Winner  

---

## 🔥 What Makes Me Different

### 🧩 The Structured Context Board Innovation
I invented a novel approach to AI attention management - the **Structured Context Board (SCB)** - an external mechanism that dynamically manages LLM attention by reducing the "haystack" to what's truly necessary. This isn't just another RAG implementation; it's a fundamental rethinking of how AI agents maintain context.

### 🎨 Creative Problem Solver
My ADHD-powered creative mind and insatiable curiosity drive me to explore every corner of technology. I don't just use tools - I reimagine them, combine them, and sometimes invent entirely new approaches.

### 🏗️ Foundation-First Builder
I believe in understanding problems at their core before building solutions. This philosophy has led me to create everything from AI tutors to behavioral intervention apps, each addressing fundamental human needs.
